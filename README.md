# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Mahnoor Ismail
### Software Engineering Final year student
#### I am a python developer.
## Current Projects:
- Simulating image classification TFLite model running on zephyr RTOS (RISCV ported) booted on Litex-vexriscv SoC on Renode.
- Burq Suite (all in one RISCV suite). Full-featured IDE for creating customised SoCs, Cores, and/or components, as well as core and SoC verification. Additionally, there is a built-in FPGA software development kit, as well as automatic RTL bit stream generation andÂ burning it on FPGA.
- VidToPick (FYP) this application will assist you in locating a specific topic among a large number of videos, as well as marking the timestamp at which the topic occurred. Machine learning models are used throughout the entire process.
